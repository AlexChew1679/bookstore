 this is due i didnt put an 'end' at   ability.rb

 class Ability
   include CanCan::Ability

   def initialize(user)
     # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
     #
       user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
         can :read, :all
         can :manage, Book do |book|
           book.try(:user) == user
